<p><small>Project based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/">cookiecutter data science project template</a>. #cookiecutterdatascience</small></p>




This project is structured following cookie cutter template.

It is runned using virtual environment by pyenv and poetry.
Below is the dependencies:

python = "^3.9"
pandas = "2.0.1"
jupyterlab = "3.6.3"
scikit-learn = "1.2.2"
matplotlib = "3.7.2"


all models artefacts are stored in models, and customized function stored in src/models

I put 2 customized function 1 for pop target data and the other one for splitting training and validation data. The splitting training was used in experiment C
